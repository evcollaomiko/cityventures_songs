[Verse 1]
**Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
And when it comes
It's so, so disappointing

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

[Verse 2]
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

[Bridge]
Let down and hang…
Let down and hang…
Let down and hang…

[Verse 3]
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (You know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (You know where you are)
Hysterical and (You know where you are)

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around**
