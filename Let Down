Let Down 
Song by Radiohead

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings, disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
When it comes, it's so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down and hang
Let down and hang
Let down and hang
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapses, floating
Bouncing back
And one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (you know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
Hysterical and (you know where you are)
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
